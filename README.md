# Stock-Prediction-Keras
Stock Market Predictions Keras for CSV files 

I used MatPlotLib to plot out the forecasts and compare them to the real values
The predictions are for the X_test split value which is in the past
Future predictions can be also made with the model
This model looks solely at patterns and uses a regression model with squared error

The model can be improved with 
-More training 
-Bigger datasets

You can swap any other singular stock
A good site to find more stock data -- https://finance.yahoo.com/
From yahoo you can adjust the time frame and dividens as well
